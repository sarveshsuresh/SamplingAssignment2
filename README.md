R CODES solutions to Sampling Problems

The following data give the geographical area (in acres) under paddy for 58 villages. Draw a sample of eight villages using SRSWOR and SRSWR, find an estimate of average area per village under paddy, an estimate of its variance and its 95% confidence interval. Execute it in R Software.

98,  270, 79, 273, 130,	158, 116, 194,  41, 33, 78, 56, 58, 19, 64, 81, 141, 58, 29, 46, 93, 127, 114, 88, 108, 58, 47, 69, 44, 56, 102, 102, 187, 161, 179, 76, 137, 179, 76, 137, 127, 104, 117, 170, 210, 101, 222, 223, 96, 114, 318, 272, 155, 292, 240, 201, 261, 189 

(1)	 Draw a random sample of size 10 using R statistical software  from 
(i)	Binominal population with parameter 12 and 0.25.
(ii)	Poisson distribution with parameter 5.2
(iii)	Normal distribution with mean 3.5 and variance 5.75
(iv)	bivariate normal population with parameters  
	and compute sample mean and sample variance. Try to observe the difference by drawing samples several times with the same as well as different populations. Increase the sample size and observe the differences in the results.  

(2)	 Consider a normal population   Draw 5, 15, 30, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 samples of size 5 using R Software. Compute  ,   and make density plots for each case.  Repeat the above process for sample sizes 15, 30, 100 and 1000. Present all the results suitably. Prepare superimposed graphs.
